- 👋 Hi, I’m @anystack100
- 👀 I’m interested in all things IT, as well as music, cars, AFL football, cricket, and I play tennis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python, to build on what I learned with it at uni, as well as Flask. I am also learning about graph DBs (Neo4j) and want to get some experience with graph APIs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...nothing really right now.
